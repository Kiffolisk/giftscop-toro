# giftscop-toro
BepInEx Giftscop plugin that replaces Amber with Toro from Doko Demo Issyo in the Pets menu.

# How to install?
Put the files in the StreamingAssets folder in the Petscop_Data folder
It should be, for example, giftscopdir/Petscop_Data/StreamingAssets/toro.png

After that, install the BepInEx plugin and get Amber in game.

# Issues
This does not work with custom languages, only the preinstalled English language (that is also default)
